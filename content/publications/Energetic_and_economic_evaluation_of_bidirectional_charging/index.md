##### Abstract

Privately used cars in Germany are parked most of the time. Considering this, and with the ramp-up of electromobility in mind, the question arises whether battery electric vehicles can additionally be used as home storage units to temporarily store solar surpluses.<br>In this work, bidirectional charging for photovoltaic self-consumption optimization is evaluated based on simulations. A simulation model is developed, which considers various loss mechanisms known from the simulation of home storage systems. The model also offers the option of adding a home storage system to the bidirectional system.<br>By parameter variation, different influencing factors of bidirectional charging for photovoltaic self-consumption optimization are examined first. Detailed loss analyses are then carried out with two bidirectional charging points (electric vehicle supply equipment, EVSE). On one hand, a real bidirectional EVSE is simulated, which is parameterized based on measured data. On the other hand, a more efficient EVSE is simulated, which has efficiencies comparable to present-day battery converters. Finally, the energetic and economic performance of different system configurations is analyzed and compared.<br>The results show that bidirectional charging can reduce grid consumption and save costs. Conversion efficiencies and vehicle power consumption lead to high losses in the simulated systems.
